# -Machine-Learning-Techniques-Applications-and-Implementations
This repository showcases projects completed during the "Machine Learning" course (Jan '24 - Apr '24) under the supervision of Prof. Nipun Batra at IIT Gandhinagar. These projects cover a diverse array of machine-learning techniques applied to different tasks, including image processing.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Decision Trees from Scratch
- **Objective**: Gain a deep understanding of decision trees by developing them from foundational principles.
- **Application**: Applied the constructed decision trees to classification tasks, enhancing comprehension of their fundamental principles and practical applications.

### 2. Activity Recognition Using Time Series Data
- **Objective**: Preprocess time series data to visualize and classify human activities like walking, running, etc.
- **Methods Used**:
  - **Decision Trees and Random Forests**: Applied for classification tasks.
  - **Feature Extraction (Tsfel Library)**: Extracted features to enhance model performance.
  - **Model Deployment**: Tested the model on real-time series data collected via mobile phones.

### 3. MNIST Dataset Classification
- **Objective**: Train and assess machine learning models on the MNIST dataset.
- **Techniques Employed**:
  - **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**: Implemented for digit classification on handwritten digit images.
  - **Logistic Regression**: Used as a benchmark for performance comparison.

### 4. Custom Image Classification Using VGG Models
- **Objective**: Classify images from a specialized dataset containing two distinct categories.
- **Approach**: Compiled and evaluated various VGG model architectures.
- **Outcome**: Conducted a thorough evaluation to determine the optimal VGG model for the classification task.
